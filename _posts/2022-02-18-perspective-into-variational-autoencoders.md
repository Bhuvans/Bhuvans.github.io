## Outline
1. Probability distributions
    1. Motivate Gaussian 
    2. Motivate mixture of Gaussians. Talk about the power of latent variables. 
2. Talk about parameter estimation methods for probability distributions - MLE, MAP and Full Bayesian.
    1. Restrict to MLE, illustrate MLE for Gaussian, MLE for mixture of Gaussians(show that there is no closed form analytical solution) by computing derivatives. Mention EM.
3. EM algorithm
    1. Rough outline of EM for gaussian mixtures. Alternative view of EM. Introduce latent variables. 
    2. EM algorithm in general. Intuitive Proof. How to use EM for filling in missing data. 
    3. Mention the singularity problem with MLE and the difficulty to compute the no. of mixtures. Motivate Variational Inference.
4. Explain variational inference - ELBO loss. 
5. Introduce VAE as the marriage of Neural Nets and graphical models. Explain that the VAE is trying to minimize ELBO loss (the KL divergence and squared error terms) and therefore tries to model the input data as a mixture of gaussians, which is powerful than ordinary AE that model data as a gaussian. 
6. Basic Pytorch code for VAE (TF2.0 side by side).

$$

\begin{aligned}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{aligned}
