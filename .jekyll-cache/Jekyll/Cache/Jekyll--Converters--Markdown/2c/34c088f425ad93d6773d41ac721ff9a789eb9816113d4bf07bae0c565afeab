<p>Hello, my name is Bhuvaneswari. I work as a Data Scientist with Schlumberger on applications of machine learning useful for the clients of the Oil and Gas Services industry. Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras where I worked on real world applications of reinforcement learning for balancing control systems. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran and Prof. Ramkrishna Pasumarthy for my Mastersâ€™ project. While at IIT Madras, I took the Reinforcement Learning course offered by Prof. Ravindran. I did not do too well in the course, but my bad grades in the course challenged me to make my Mastersâ€™ project work. And the success in my Mastersâ€™ project gave me confidence to pursue studying RL, and understanding in detail the math fundamentals of the subject with the help of the recorded video lectures of Prof. Ravindranâ€™s RL course. And even before this, in my previous birth, I was quite fascinated about micro-controllers and electronic circuits. I pursued them as hobby projects during my undergraduate studies and derived great pleasure out of seeing them kick into action after several failed attempts.</p>
