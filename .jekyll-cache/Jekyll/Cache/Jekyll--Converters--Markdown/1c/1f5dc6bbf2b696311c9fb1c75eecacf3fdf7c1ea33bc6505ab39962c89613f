<p>Hello, my name is Bhuvaneswari. I work as a Data Scientist with Schlumberger on applications of machine learning useful for the clients of the Oil and Gas Services industry. Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras where I worked on real world applications of reinforcement learning for balancing control systems. And even before this, in my previous birth, I was quite fascinated about micro-controllers and electronic circuits. I pursued them as hobby projects during my undergraduate studies and derived great pleasure out of seeing them kick into action after several failed attempts.</p>

<p>This is my LinkedIn page. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvaneswari-s-07217955/">LinkedIn</a></p>
